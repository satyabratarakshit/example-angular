                        Angular provides an EventEmitter class that is used when publishing values from a component
                        through the @Output() decorator. EventEmitter extends RxJS Subject, adding an emit() method so
                        it can send arbitrary values. When you call emit(), it passes the emitted value to the next()
                        method of any subscribed observer.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Observables provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your
                        application. Observables offer significant benefits over other techniques for event handling,
                        asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values.

                    <li>
                        Observables are declarativeâ€”that is, you define a function for publishing values, but it is
                        not executed until a consumer subscribes to it. The subscribed consumer then receives
                        notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe.
